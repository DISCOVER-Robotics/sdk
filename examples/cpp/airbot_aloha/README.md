# AIRBOT Play Ã— ALOHA

## Introduction

This project contains the codes about demonstration (single or double arm manipulation) for raw data collecting, data convertor to convert raw data to hdf5 file and data replaying.

> **Docker Notation**
>
> If you want to install and use these packages in Docker, you should run your container with some necessary args, for example:
>
> ```bash
> docker run -it --name airbot_play --network=host --privileged=true -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules,/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY ubuntu:20.04
> ```
> And you probably can not install the deb packages when they are in `/root`. In this case, you can move the packages and the terminal to `/tmp` first:
>
> ```bash
> mv airbot_*.deb /tmp/ && cd /tmp
> ```
>
> In some Docker Containers, there is no `sudo` command, you can just remove it from the commands below.

## Environment Setup

### Data Collection & Convertion Environment

Firstly, download the core control deb package from releases of [arm-control](https://git.qiuzhi.tech:20000/airbot-play/control/arm-control/-/releases).  The package file name should be in the format of `airbot_play_\<version>_\<arch>.deb`. Then install the package with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3 udev kmod iproute2 libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module -y
sudo service udev restart && udevadm control --reload
sudo apt install ./airbot_play_*.deb -y
```

Then, download the AIRBOT Play ALOHA deb package from releases of [airbot-aloha](https://git.qiuzhi.tech:20000/airbot-play/control/sdk/-/tree/feature-update-docs/examples/cpp/airbot_aloha?ref_type=heads). The package file name should be in the format of `airbot_aloha_\<version>_\<arch>.deb.` Then install the package with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install ./airbot_aloha_*.deb
```

### Data Replay Environment

>- [Data Conversion Environment](#Data-Conversion-Environment) needs to be configured first.
>
>- This configuration will install the AIRBOT Play Python API.

Firstly, download the [arm-control python-interface source code zip file](https://git.qiuzhi.tech:20000/airbot-play/control/sdk/-/archive/develop/sdk-develop.zip?path=python). Then execute the following command to build the project:

```bash
sudo apt install librosconsole-dev liburdf-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev git -y
unzip sdk-develop-python.zip && sudo rm sdk-develop-python.zip
cd sdk-develop-python/python
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make -j32 && cd ..
```

Finally, install the airbot python package via pip:

```bash
pip install . -i https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/
```

## Data Collection

> * [Data Collection & Convertion Environment](#Data-Collection-&-Convertion-Environment) needs to be configured first.
>
> * The task name should be reasonable, and it is recommended to include time in the name to distinguish the same task data collected at different times.

### Starting Robotic Arms
1. Prepare all teaching arms and execution robotic arms.
2. Connect the power sources of all robotic arms (order doesn't matter).
3. **First**, connect the teaching arm via Type-C data cable (corresponding to CAN0), **then** connect the execution arm, too (corresponding to CAN1). For dual-arm operations, follow the above sequence for the left-side robotic arm first, then the right-side arm.
4. Long-press the power button on each robotic arm to turn them on.
5. Ensure that the robotic arms are at the zero pose; otherwise, perform a [zero calibration](https://discover-robotics.github.io/docs/manual/#_11).

### Connecting Cameras
Data collection typically requires multiple cameras, and the connection order can be as follows:

- Single-arm task sequence: Arm-mounted camera left eye -> Arm-mounted camera right eye -> Base-mounted camera
- Dual-arm task: Left arm camera -> Right arm camera -> Environment camera top -> Environment camera bottom

The above sequence is just a reference: the actual connection order depends on the number of cameras and their placement. Generally, prioritize connecting arm-mounted, left-side, and overhead cameras first.

### Starting Data Collection

```bash
airbot_demonstrate \
    -c <cam_device_0> -c <cam_device_1> -c <cam_device_2> \
    -mts <max_time_step> \
    -tn <task_name> \
    -se <start_episode_index> \
    -f 15 \
    -sjp <joint_pos_1> <joint_pos_2> <joint_pos_3> <joint_pos_4> <joint_pos_5> <joint_pos_6> <gripper_pos>
```
For dual-arm tasks, simply replace the command `airbot_demonstrate` with `airbot_demonstrate_dual`.

#### Explanation of Parameters

- `-c`: Device number of the USB cameras, the order of multiple device numbers (i.e., camera sequence) is specified by the specific task.
    - Typically, follow the connection order, where available camera device numbers are incremented by even numbers, such as 0, 2, 4...
    - If your computer has a built-in regular camera, it occupies one device number, and externally connected camera device numbers start from 2 and increment by even numbers: 2, 4, 6... (if cameras were connected before the computer started, the device number of the built-in camera may not be 0; in rare cases, after connecting cameras post-startup, the built-in camera's device number may not be 0).
    - If your computer has a built-in depth/structured light camera (like Windows Hello camera), the RGB camera and depth camera each occupy a device number, and externally connected camera device numbers start from 4 and increment by even numbers: 4, 6, 8...
- `-mts`: Specifies the maximum number of frames to be captured; specified by the specific task.
When reaching the maximum time steps, the program will prompt.
- `-tn`: Task name, specified by the specific task.
    - The collected data will be saved in the `demonstrations/raw/<task_name>` folder in the current directory.
- `-se`: Starting episode number for collection, default is 0.
    - After interruption, you can modify this value to continue collection without overwriting previous data.
    - When data is mistakenly saved, specifying this episode number allows for re-collection to overwrite existing data.
    - When collecting data multiple times after executing the command, the episode numbers of subsequent collections will increment from this base.
    - Each set of data is saved in the `demonstrations/raw/<task_name>/<episode_id>` folder.
- `-sjp`: Initial positions of each joint and gripper before starting collection for each episode; defaults to 0 if not used. Specify values based on the actual situation of the specific task.
- `-f`: Data collection frequency, default is 15Hz.

#### Excution Example

```bash
airbot_demonstrate -c 0 -mts 100 -tn test_task -sjp 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
```

#### Key Descriptions

> Do not press or hold keys continuously; otherwise, the key's behavior will repeat sequentially.

After excuting the command above, the terminal will be cleaned and you can use keyboard to control. The key descriptions are as follows:

* `g`: Toggle gravity compensation on/off.
* `Spacebar`: Start/stop episode data recording.
* `q`: Discard the current record.
* `0`: Return the robotic arm to the initial position.
* `p`: Print current robotic arm states information.

#### Operational Steps

1. Start the program, and the real-time windows of each camera will appear (if not all cameras start, try adjusting device numbers or checking camera connections; try connecting only one camera per docking station; some computers may support only 1-2 external cameras when USB ports share the same bus, consider changing the computer).
2. Press `Spacebar` to start recording data and simultaneously, teleoperate the robotic arm to complete the task.
3. After completing the task, wait to collect the specified number of frames (the number of frames used to complete the task should be as close as possible to the maximum collection frames):
    - If the teaching opration is not acceptable, press `q` to discard the current teaching record, then press `0` to control the robotic arm to return to the initial position.
    - If it is acceptable, press `Spacebar` to save the current teaching record. After saving, the robotic arm will automatically return to the initial position.
4. (Optional) In the `demonstrations/raw/<task_name>` folder in the current directory, check the recorded episodes.
    - Each collected episode data includes: videos recorded by 3 cameras (.avi), and a robotic arm status record file (.json).

**Additional Notes:**

1. Try to ensure that the completed task actions are completed **just before reaching the maximum frame count**, i.e., do not end the action too early.

2. The robotic arm movement speed should not be too fast; otherwise, the collected information will be sparse, and the image quality will not be high.

3. It is recommended to store the collected task data folder <task_name> in the same directory structure on a **portable hard drive** as a backup.

## Data Conversion
> [Data Collection & Convertion Environment](#Data-Collection-&-Convertion-Environment) needs to be configured first.

In the same path where the data collection command was executed, run the following command to save the data in hdf5 format:

```bash
python3 -m airbot_aloha.convert_episodes.py -rn 1 -cn 0 -tn test_task -se 0 -ee 0
```

**Parameter explanation:**

- `-cn`: Specify camera names.
- `-tn`: Specify the task name, same as specified during data collection.
- `-se`: Specify the starting episode number of the data.
- `-ee`: Specify the ending episode number of the data.
- `-rn`: For dual-arm tasks, specify `-rn` 2.

This command will search for the specified task data in the `demonstrations/raw` folder in the current directory and convert them to hdf5 files into the `demonstrations/hdf5` folder.

Similarly, it is recommended to store the converted task data folder `<task_name>` in the same directory structure on a portable hard drive as a backup.

## Data Replay (Optional)

> Data replay can be used to verify if there are issues with collected data, init states of the environment, etc. (requires prior setup of the data [replay environment](#data-replay-environment)).

The data replay command and its parameters are as follows:

```bash
python3 -m airbot_aloha.replay_episodes.py -rn 1 -tn test_task -ei 0 -cb 1 -ii
```

**Parameter explanation:**

- `-tn`: Specify the task name.
- `-ei`: Specify the ID corresponding to the HDF file.
- `-cb`: Initial CAN ID; increment autoly for multiple robotic arms.
- `-ii`: Do not replay camera data.
- `-ia`: Do not replay action data.
- `-rn`: For dual-arm tasks, specify `-rn` 2.
